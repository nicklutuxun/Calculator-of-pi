# Calculator-of-pi

Hi there!
This is a simple program to calculate the approximate value of pi.

The main idea is using Maclaurin series to approach the actual value of pi.

In the beginning, you will be asked to input the value of n, which will be used by the program to calculate the sum of first n terms.
The result of this program is one graph shown how the sum approaches to pi and the time of running it.

Hope you enjoy it!
